# air quality index
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring and analysis system that provides real-time data on air quality levels in urban areas. The system aims to inform citizens, policymakers, and stakeholders about air quality conditions, enabling them to take necessary actions to mitigate air pollution and protect public health.

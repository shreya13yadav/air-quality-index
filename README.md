# air quality index
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring and analysis system that provides real-time data on air quality levels in urban areas. The system aims to inform citizens, policymakers, and stakeholders about air quality conditions, enabling them to take necessary actions to mitigate air pollution and protect public health.
Scope:

The project will involve the following components:

1. Air Quality Monitoring: Installation of air

quality monitoring stations in urban areas to measure pollutant concentrations, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (03), and other relevant pollutants.

2. Data Collection and Analysis: Collection of

real-time data from monitoring stations and analysis of AQI levels, including calculation of pollutant concentrations and identification of pollution sources.

3. AQI Calculation and Categorization:

Calculation of AQI levels based on pollutant concentrations and categorization of AQI levels into different ranges (e.g., good, moderate, unhealthy, very unhealthy, hazardous).

4. Data Visualization and Dissemination:

Development of a user-friendly interface to display real-time AQI data, including maps, charts, and graphs, and dissemination of AQI information to the public through various channels (e.g., website, mobile app, social media).

5. Public Awareness and Education: Development

of public awareness and education campaigns to inform citizens about air quality issues, health impacts, and mitigation strategies.
